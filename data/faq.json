    "question": "What is MMCC?",
    "answer": "Meerkat Millionaires Country Club is a generative meerkat NFT collection on Solana with a total supply of 9,999. MMCC aims to grow a fun and family-like community for its holders with its epic cartoon-style art.\nMMCC has one unique twist — 100% of royalties are returned to its members! Project minters receive 15% of all royalties for life, and the remaining 85% are distributed to current holders. Every #MeerkatMonday, minters and holders receive their share, whether they’re out playing golf or sipping champagne."

    "question": "What is a DAO?",
    "answer": "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) offer a new and promising way to organize people around collective goals and interests. This crypto-native structure has emerged as an alternative to the traditional corporation and allows individual contributors to collaborate at scale through decentralized governance and ownership. In a DAO, every member has the opportunity to influence the project’s direction and benefit directly from its success."

    "question": "Do I have to join the DAO to receive MMCC royalties?",

    "question": "Who should join ClubDAO?",
    "answer": "ClubDAO is currently open only to holders of MMCC. Any meerkat holder who would like to have a voice in shaping the future decisions, partnerships, and activities of ClubDAO is encouraged to join. Although there are no special skills or experience required, we are actively seeking contributors with engineering, legal, marketing, and other technical expertise for leadership positions in the DAO."

    "question": "What are the perks of membership in ClubDOA?",
    "answer": "As a member of ClubDAO, you’ll get to participate in decision making around DAO activities, events, partnerships, and future direction. If you choose, you’ll also be able to contribute beyond your vote according to your own skills and interests. And there will almost certainly be other perks of membership in the future, but it is up to the DAO to determine them!"

              When the team at VenusLabs created MMCC, they set out from the
              start to do things differently. Bucking the trend of cookie-cutter
              profile pic collections, MMCC became the first project on Solana
              to offer 100% of royalties back to its minters and holders.
              <br /><br />
              They made that unconventional choice because they understood that,
              in their own words, “the most innovative force that exists is the
              community.”
              <br /><br />
              It was their vision to empower MMCC holders to take true ownership
              of the project and accountability for its future success. So they
              built a mechanism to fund the community directly, equipping them
              with the resources to do whatever they could imagine and achieve
              together.
              <br /><br />
              From that vision, ClubDAO was born.
              <br /><br />
              Now, we’re more than fun-loving, golf-club-swinging,
              nude-beach-frequenting meerkat millionaires. We’re a #MeerkatMob
              building our future together.
